# AI-project
An AI project from cs50 ai.
The task is identifying which traffic sign appears in photographs using neural network.
The detail is on https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/projects/5/traffic/#:~:text=identify%20which%20traffic%20sign%20appears%20in%20a%20photograph.
I'm going to show only code in Python.


Speacial Thank to CS50ai
